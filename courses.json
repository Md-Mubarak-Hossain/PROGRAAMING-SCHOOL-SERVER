        "description": "Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.According to Sun, 3 billion devices run Java. There are many devices where Java is currently used. Some of them are as follows:Desktop Applications such as acrobat reader, media player, antivirus, etc.Web Applications such as irctc.co.in, javatpoint.com, etc.Enterprise Applications such as banking applications.Mobile,Embedded System,Smart Card,Robotics Games, etc,Standalone applications are also known as desktop applications or window-based applications. These are traditional software that we need to install on every machine. Examples of standalone application are Media player, antivirus, etc. AWT and Swing are used in Java for creating standalone applications",

        "description": "Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.",

C++ runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This C++ tutorial adopts a simple and practical approach to describe the concepts of C++ for beginners to advanded software engineers.C++ is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning C++:C++ is very close to hardware, so you get a chance to work at a low level which gives you lot of control in terms of memory management, better performance and finally a robust software development.C++ programming gives you a clear understanding about Object Oriented Programming. You will understand low level implementation of polymorphism when you will implement virtual tables and virtual table pointers, or dynamic type identification.C++ is one of the every green programming languages and loved by millions of software developers. If you are a great C++ programmer then you will never sit without work and more importantly you will get highly paid for your work.C++ is the most widely used programming languages in application and system programming. So you can choose your area of interest of software development.C++ really teaches you the difference between compiler, linker and loader, different data types, storage classes, variable types their scopes etc.There are 1000s of good reasons to learn C++ Programming. But one thing for sure, to learn any programming language, not only C++, you just need to code, and code and finally code until you become expert.",

        "description": "Ruby is a scripting language designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto, also known as Matz. It runs on a variety of platforms, such as Windows, Mac OS, and the various versions of UNIX. This tutorial gives a complete understanding on Ruby.This tutorial has been prepared for beginners to help them understand the basic to advanced concepts related to Ruby Scripting languages.Before you start practicing with various types of examples given in this tutorial, we are making an assumption that you are already aware of computer programs and programming languages in general.Ruby is a pure object-oriented language and everything appears to Ruby as an object. Every value in Ruby is an object, even the most primitive things: strings, numbers and even true and false. Even a class itself is an object that is an instance of the Class class. This chapter will take you through all the major functionalities related to Object Oriented Ruby.A class is used to specify the form of an object and it combines data representation and methods for manipulating that data into one neat package. The data and methods within a class are called members of the class.When you define a class, you define a blueprint for a data type. This doesn't actually define any data, but it does define what the class name means, that is, what an object of the class will consist of and what operations can be performed on such an object.",

PHP is basically used for developing web based software applications. This tutorial helps you to build your base with PHP.PHP started out as a small open source project that evolved as more and more people found out how useful it was. Rasmus Lerdorf unleashed the first version of PHP way back in 1994.PHP is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning PHP:PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites.It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.PHP is pleasingly zippy in its execution, especially when compiled as an Apache module on the Unix side. The MySQL server, once started, executes even very complex queries with huge result sets in record-setting time.PHP supports a large number of major protocols such as POP3, IMAP, and LDAP. PHP4 added support for Java and distributed object architectures (COM and CORBA), making n-tier development a possibility for the first time.",

        "description": "Kotlin is a programming language introduced by JetBrains in 2011, the official designer of the most intelligent Java IDE, named Intellij IDEA. Kotlin is free, has been free and will remain free. It is developed under the Apache 2.0 license and the source code is available on GitHub.This is a strongly statically typed general-purpose programming language that runs on JVM. In 2017, Google announced Kotlin is an official language for android development. Kotlin is an open source programming language that combines object-oriented programming and functional features into a unique platform. The content is divided into various chapters that contain related topics with simple and useful examples.Currently, Kotlin mainly targets the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but also compiles to JavaScript. Kotlin is influenced by other popular programming languages such as Java, C#, JavaScript, Scala and Groovy. The syntax of Kotlin may not be exactly similar to Java Programming Language, however, internally Kotlin is reliant on the existing Java Class library to produce wonderful results for the programmers. Kotlin provides interoperability, code safety, and clarity to the developers around the world.Kotlin is very high in demand and all major companies are moving towards Kotlin to develop their web and mobile applications.Average annual salary for a Kotlin developer is around $130,000. Though it can vary depending on the location. Following are the great companies who are using Kotlin:Google,Amazon,Pinterest,Uber,Trello,Coursera,Basecamp,Codra",

        "description": "React Native is a JavaScript framework for building native mobile apps. It uses the React framework and offers large amount of inbuilt components and APIs.This tutorial is designed for JavaScript and React developers who aspire to learn mobile building skills. By following this course, you will expand your React and JavaScript knowledge, learn some concepts of functional programming, and prepare to enter the mobile world. Since JavaScript world is moving forward, we will keep up with it and use EC6 syntax in this tutorial.To be able to follow this tutorial, you should be familiar with React and have solid JavaScript knowledge. Even if you do not have previous experience with React, you should be able to follow it. In this tutorial, we will explain some fundamental React concepts.For better understanding of React Native concepts, we will borrow a few lines from the official documentation −React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app; you build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.",
